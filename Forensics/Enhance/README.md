# Enhance!

The given link downloads a __drawing.flag.svg__ file which when passed through binwalk 
gives the information that it is actually an __XML Document__ so on viewing the __XML Document__
in Vscode, I could see the individual letters of the flag inside the __style__ , __span__tag
.On concatenating them I get the original flag.

The flag is:
picoCTF{3nh4nc3d_aab729dd}
