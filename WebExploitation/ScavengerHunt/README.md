#  Scavenger Hunt

This website looks like a plain website made using css, html and javascript. There are two __endpoints__ namely __What__ and __How__. ON naivgating to the __index.html__, we get the first hint of the original flag which was mentioned as:

> Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mycss.css">
<script type="application/javascript" src="myjs.js"></script>
```

There are two other pages, one for the styling part namely __mycss.css__ nd the other file is __myjs.js__.
On opening the inspect element and navigating to the stylesheets page that is __mycss.css__, we basically get the __second__ clue for the original flag. The following line was mentioned at the end of the css file.

> CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0

Finally on opening the next script file __myjs.js__, we can get another clue about the other parts of the original flag. The clue present in the __myjs.js__ file was:

> How can I keep Google from indexing my website?

On searching this in internet, there were some articles related to __robots.txt__, adding a __meta tag with index="noindex" value__. robots.txt is a file present in the root directory of your application that lists out the endpoints that are restricted for the site crawlers, webbots. On navigating to the following link [http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/robots.txt](http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/robots.txt), we get to see the next hint that the given application designed is an __Apache server__. The clue present in __robots.txt__ file was:

> User-agent: * <br/>
> Disallow: /index.html <br/>
> Part 3: t_0f_pl4c <br/>
> I think this is an apache server... can you Access  the next flag?

Apache servers contains a distribution configuration file named as __.htaccess__ which helps in changing website persmisison without changing server configuration files. On navigating to the following link [http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/.htaccess](http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/.htaccess), I got the next hint for the original flag. The hint mentioned was:

> Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k <br/>
> I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.

In case of Mac, there is an endpoint named as __/.DS_Store__, on navigating to the following link [http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/.DS_Store](http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/.DS_Store), I finally was able to get the last portion of the original flag.
