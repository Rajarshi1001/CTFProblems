# Logon

This problem has a link that asks for credentials namely __username__ and __password__. THe 
login screen seems to allow every users but displays the message __No flag for you__.
on inspecting the index.html/flag, we find that there are three cookies namely __admin__ which is set
__False__, __username__ which is set to __joe__, and __password__ cookies. Since the __admin__ cookie is 
set to __False__, maybe the cookie is using a separate variable to store the result which is 
preventing us to see the flag displayed on the screen. On setting the __admin__ flag to __TRue__
, and refreshing the page we get the correct flag.

The corresponding flag is: __picoCTF{th3_c0nsp1r4cy_l1v3s_0c98aacc}__
